                                From any Eth supported wallet - you can put the messages in the input(HEX) field while sending a transaction to the Akashick Address.
                                However do note, you need to  <a href="https://codebeautify.org/string-hex-converter">convert to Hex</a> and add
                                0x in the starting. Some wallets such as MyEtherWallet has a sign transaction
                                feature which does this automatically for you.
                                <br><br>
                                Any data can be converted and represented as HEX, including files, pdf, images etc. This can be used to
                                timestamp or communicate. However at this moment Akashick supports messages only and if you are sending a file
                                include instructions in HEX for people to convert and view, such as file type etc.

                                You do not need to send any ETH to send a message. However as messages are embedded on-chain
                                there is inevitable transaction fee on the <a href="https://rebrand.ly/akashick-mainnet">MainNet version of Akashick.</a><br> <br>We also have a <a href="https://rebrand.ly/akashick-rinkeby-testnet">Rinkeby-Testnet Version</a>  tied to same address , where users can send messages by
                                getting free rinketh from rinkeby faucets - to note: testnets doesnot offer 100% immutability but are still cencorship resistant to some extent.
                                MainNet and Rinkeby Testnet Versions of this installation are hosted at different url's and the message chain is not linked to each-other, however the
                                wallet address is same for both.<br>
                                <br>We have created the testnet version for users who just wish to test without real eth fee(which is very minor), or are unable to obtain real eth
                                and need to put their word out.

                                Any extra funds send to the mainnet wallet will be used for its further development(we have some great ideas for the environment including festivals, NFT's and more),
                                maintainence, spreading the awarness, and install the project in public places, the
                                fundamental goal of this art project is also as well to spread awarness of blockchain systems,
                                decentralized tech and to get people to use and interact with these emerging environments.

                                Akasha (ākāśa आकाश) is the Sanskrit word for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)">'aether'</a>, 'sky', or 'atmospher - an expression for freedom.
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records">Akashic Records</a> is said to be compendium/knowledge of events encoded forever in a subconcious cloud of existence.
                                'ck' is obtained from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)">Magick</a>, a reconcillation of one's free will.

                                with the chain in an open collaborative way. If you are a 3D-2D artist and would like to be a part of it, get in touch, send in your
                                art.<br><br>

                                We have some exciting thoughts around gamification, events in the space, collaboration with other decentralised games and NFT Artvertses,
                                however still in early stages. If you would like to be a part of
                                it or have your own ideas, write to us. <br><br>
